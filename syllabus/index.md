Course Description
------------------
The course covers a survey of various cyber security attacks and countermeasures used in network, web, database and application-level security. Topics include operating systems security, network security, web security, covert channels, and static/dynamic code analysis. Lab exercises and projects provide hands-on experience in understanding cyber security attacks and countermeasures. These include Cross-site scripting, SQL injection, Buffer Overflow, TCP/IP attacks, Web tracking, and ethical hacking. The course highlights _hands-on-approach_, and requires students to conduct a series of lab exercises. Through these labs, students can enhance their understanding of the principles, and be able to apply those principles to solve real problems. 

Prerequisites
-------------
CS320 and CS330 with a grade of 2.0 or higher
or 
IFS225, IFS230 and IFS320 with a grade of 2.0 or higher

Required Textbook
-----------------
Wenliang Du, <a href="https://ycp.textbookx.com/book/Internet-Security-A-HandsOn-Approach/9781733003964/?course_id=4643336">Internet Security : A Hands-On Approach</a>. Wenliang Du; 3 edition, 2022, ISBN: 9781733003964. 

Course Structure and Expectations
---------------------------------
Class meetings will primarily involve discussing questions related to the topic and working on corresponding lab exercises designed to illustrate concepts from the lecture notes. Therefore, you should come to each class prepared to work on the lab and bring any questions you have about the material.

Additionally, there will be a series of homework assignments, consisting of both written and programming parts, assigned at approximately 1-2 week intervals. These assignments are to be completed individually.

A special thanks goes to Prof. Wenliang Du for his contributions on the [SEED security labs](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/) that will be adopted in our course projects.

There's an old saying, often attributed to Confucius: "Give a man a fish, and you'll feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you'll feed him for a lifetime." You will only get as much out of this course as you choose to put into it. Since we will be covering a significant amount of material at a rapid pace, it is imperative that you keep up by participating in the class meetings.

You must have completed the lab activities up to and including the one for the current class meeting in order to receive assistance on the current programming assignment. The best way to learn about Cybersecurity is through practice. Our class meetings will be very hands-on and interactive, so you will need to attend every session on time, having reviewed any suggested readings, topics, and applications, and respectfully participate in all class activities.

To achieve the course objectives, you must take responsibility for your own learning and participate as an active learner.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand the various cyber security threats to networks, operating systems, web, databases, and software applications.
- Demonstrate ethical hacking techniques in cyber security.
- Familiarize yourself with automated tools to analyze computer networks and applications for cyber security weaknesses.
- Understand the different types of malware that can affect computer systems.
- Learn techniques used by attackers to conduct network, web, and application attacks.
- Understand countermeasures against threats and attacks on networks, operating systems, web, and software applications.
- Conduct code analysis to identify security flaws and weaknesses in software.

Course website
-----------------

Please check the course web page, <https://ycpcs.github.io/cs335-spring2025/>, regularly for important announcements.

Reading assignments
-----------------

Readings from your text book will be assigned throughout the semester. You will find the readings listed in the Course Schedule. <strong>You are encouraged to read the scheduled material before coming to class.</strong>


Homework and Lab Assignments
-----------------

Homework assignments will be derived from the lab activities conducted during class and may include both written and programming components. While collaboration is encouraged, each student must submit their own solutions to demonstrate their understanding of the material.

Assignments and labs will be posted on the course web page,  [https://ycpcs.github.io/cs335-spring2025](<https://ycpcs.github.io/cs335-spring2025>). All homework assignments will be submitted as a __single .pdf__ to <a href="https://cs.ycp.edu/marmoset/">https://cs.ycp.edu/marmoset/</a>. If you have handwritten solutions, PLEASE USE A SCANNER APP to generate the .pdf. You are responsible for ensuring your submission and screenshots are legible.

<!-- **You MUST make a legitimate attempt to complete every homework assignment.** I reserve the right to fail any student who does not make a good faith effort to complete all of the homework assignments. -->

Late assignments will be marked down 20% per day late. **No credit will be given for assignments that are more than three (3) days late.**

Any Programing assignments will be graded based on the following criteria:

> 4: **Superior.** The program extends the basic requirements significantly by implementing additional graphical features covered in the text and other resources.
>
> 3-3.5: **Good.** The program goes beyond the basic requirements by embellishing the final output using techniques discussed in class.
>
> 2-2.5: **Average.** The program meets only the basic requirements of the assignment.
>
> 1: **Below Average.** The program produces mostly incorrect output or shows little attempt at a solution to the problem.
>
> 0: **Failure.** The program does not execute.

Final Project
-----------------

The project will focus on a topic of interest that is _not_ covered in class. The goal of the final project is to allow students to explore a particular issue in greater depth. To ensure continuous progress, there will be periodic milestones throughout the semester. The project will culminate in a final demonstration during the exam period, showcasing all the functionality developed.

Quizzes
-----------------

<strong>Quizzes will be open-book, closed-notes.</strong> They will last approximately 60 minutes and will be administered at the beginning of the class period.

<strong>Quizzes may include a programming component.</strong> The second half of the class may be used for instruction and/or laboratory work.
<strong>A total of two quizzes will be administered.</strong>

<strong>No make-up quiz will be given without approval of the instructor prior to class unless proof of extreme emergency or illness is provided.</strong>

Data collection statement
-----------------
As part of the regular ABET accreditation process for the undergraduate programs in computer science, we will be collecting samples of students' work in each of our undergraduate classes. As a result, some of your labs, assignments and exams may be used to present to the ABET evaluators.

Academic Integrity
-----------------

York College’s mission statement stipulates that strict adherence to principles of academic honesty is expected of all students. Therefore, academic dishonesty will not be tolerated at York College. Academic dishonesty refers to actions such as, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabricating research, falsifying academic documents, etc., and includes all situations where students make use of the work of others and claim such work as their own.

The following policy pertains to homework and graded (individual) Lab assignments:

> All graded (individual) assignments are to be completed individually. I encourage you to discuss high level concepts with other students, but any work you submit **must be yours alone**.
>
> Direct copying of code or other work from other students, web sites, or other sources **is absolutely forbidden under any circumstances**.
>
> Any sources (books, websites, articles, fellow students, etc.), except for the course textbook and lecture notes, that you consult in completing an assignment **must be properly acknowledged**. In general, I strongly discourage you from using any resource not explicitly listed in the course syllabus or on the course web page. When you work on a programming assignment, it must be **your** program, not your adaptation of someone else's program.

There may be some non-graded lab assignments (I will precisely stress that) - therefore, you may work with other students on them. However, I do expect you to complete them. You are encouraged to utilize the class time to work on the labs and ask any questions about them.

When a faculty member believes a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty, the faculty member must inform the student in writing and then has ten business days from that written notification to the student to report the incident to the Dean of Academic Affairs and the Department Chair. Documentation related to instances of academic dishonesty will be kept on file in the student’s permanent record. If the academic dishonesty is the student’s first offense, the faculty member will have the discretion to decide on a suitable sanction up to a grade of 0 for the course. Students are not permitted to withdraw from a course in which they have been accused of academic dishonesty.

Attendance and Participation
-----------------
I expect you to attend class and participate regularly in class activities. If you miss a class, please notify me in advance. You are responsible for all material covered in class, regardless of whether or not you were present. If you attend and participate in class regularly, you can expect to receive full credit for attendance and participation. Frequent absence and/or lack of participation will reduce the credit you receive for attendance and participation. You are responsible for keeping up with the reading assignments as described in the course schedule.

Professionalism
-----------------

I expect you to conduct yourself as a professional in this course. Professionalism includes:

-   Respect for and courteous interaction with peers, faculty and facilities;
-   Integrity, which includes at its core honesty, responsibility and accountability for one’s own actions;
-   Sensitivity and appreciation for diverse cultures, backgrounds, and life experiences;
-   Constructive evaluation, which means that criticism is offered and accepted in a productive manner;
-   Self-reflection and identification of one’s own strengths and weaknesses;
-   Responsibility for one’s own education and learning;
-   An attitude that fosters professional behavior in colleagues and peers;
-   Punctuality at meetings and class sessions;
-   Attentive behavior during class sessions, avoiding personal or social use of cell phones, laptops, or other electronic devices;
-   Acknowledgement of the Kinsley Engineering Center as a professional workplace, and treatment of this facility as a business or office space, not as an informal space.

I reserve the right to enforce this code through the York College Code of Student Conduct.

Academic Integrity Policy (Philosophy Statement)
-----------------

York College of Pennsylvania, as an institution of higher education, serves to promote and sustain the creation, acquisition, and dissemination of knowledge. In order to fulfill this purpose, an environment of integrity, dependability and honesty must be maintained by all members of the York College community. Without a foundation based on intellectual honesty and integrity, the very ability to uphold the academic endeavors that York College strives to pursue is inhibited. The Spartan Oath embodies the expectation that all members of the York College community foster an environment of integrity and responsibility. Recognize that adhering to an ethical standard of honesty leads to professional, mature and responsible citizens, and enables society at large to trust our scholarship, research, and conferred degrees. Thus, each member of the York College community must be truthful, honest, personally and professionally responsible, and respect the intellectual contributions of others.

The following policy pertains to all graded work in this course:

> All graded (individual) assignments are to be completed individually. I encourage you to discuss high level concepts with other students, but any work you submit **must be yours alone**.
>
> Direct copying of solutions or work from other students, web sites, or other sources **is absolutely forbidden under any circumstances**.
>
> Any sources (books, websites, articles, fellow students, etc.), except for the course textbook and lecture notes, that you consult in completing an assignment **must be properly acknowledged**. In general, I strongly discourage you from using any resource not explicitly listed in the course syllabus or on the course web page but rather asking the instructor for assistance.
>
> **Exams must be completed individually using only the resources from the course.**

You may work with other students on labs. However, we do expect you to complete and submit them, and they count towards your participation grade: see "Lab Policy" below.

Definition of Academic Dishonesty
-----------------

Engaging in academic dishonesty violates York College's academic integrity policy and is strictly prohibited. Examples include, but are not limited to, cheating on assignments or exams, plagiarism (using someone else's words or ideas without proper attribution), improper paraphrasing, fabricating research, falsifying academic documents, submitting work completed for another course, and turning in work not done independently (unless part of an explicitly collaborative project).

Academic Integrity Procedure – Reporting
-----------------

-   When a faculty member believes a student has violated the Academic Integrity Policy, the faculty member is encouraged to discuss the incident in person with the student promptly, identifying the sanction he or she is going to apply. The faculty member should then reiterate the charge and sanction in writing to the student.
-   The faculty member has full discretion to determine a suitable sanction, such as a “0” on the assignment in question, up to a course grade of “0”. In the case of an egregious first offense, the faculty member may request that the Student Welfare Committee conduct a hearing and determine a sanction, which may involve academic probation, suspension, or dismissal from the College.
-   The faculty member has ten days from the written notification to the student to report the incident to the Department Chair and Associate Provost of Academic Services. The faculty member must submit as part of the report: 1) a detailed description of the incident, 2) a course syllabus, 3) an assignment sheet or assignment instructions, 4) the assignment in question, and 5) supporting documentation, such as copied material. The documentation will be kept on file in the student’s permanent record.
-   Students cannot withdraw from a course in which they have been accused of academic dishonesty, until the accusation is withdrawn by the faculty member, or is overturned by the Student Welfare Committee or the Associate Provost of Academic Services. Academic Integrity Procedure – Appeals
-   Students who believe they have been unjustly charged or sanctioned have ten days after receiving written notification from their instructor regarding the incident to file an appeal with the Student Welfare Committee by submitting a formal letter to the Associate Provost of Academic Services.
-   If an appeal is filed, the Student Welfare Committee will schedule a hearing which includes inviting the student and faculty member to attend to provide additional information or clarity regarding the incident. The Student Welfare Committee will then review the charge and/or sanction.
-   If the Associate Provost of Academic Services determines that the incident of academic dishonesty is the student’s second or subsequent offense, he or she will provide written documentation to the student, faculty member, and Department Chair. The Student Welfare Committee will automatically conduct a hearing to review the charge and decide on an appropriate sanction: academic probation, suspension or dismissal from the College.
-   Academic Services will receive written notification of the Student Welfare Committee’s decision. Students who are unsatisfied with the decision may submit a second and final written appeal to the Associate Provost of Academic Services within 72 hours of receiving notification of the Student Welfare Committee’s decision. All decisions made by the Associate Provost of Academic Services will be final.


Use of Personal Technology in the Classroom
-----------------

While York College recognizes students' need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDAs, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate. The college recognizes and supports faculty members' authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.

Communication Standards
-----------------

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers. Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations. In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking. Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.

Student Accessibility Services
-----------------

In accordance with the provisions of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, York College and its faculty are obliged to make reasonable classroom and physical accommodations for students with disabilities. If you are a student with a disability in need of classroom accommodations and have not already registered with Student Accessibility Services, please see the [SAS webpage](https://www.ycp.edu/about-us/offices-and-departments/student-success/student-accessibility-services/) for more information and to complete the online form to apply for accommodations. You may also contact <sas@ycp.edu> to establish the accommodations for which you are eligible.

Advice
-----------------

- **Start Projects Early**: Don’t wait until the last minute to begin your projects. They can be time-consuming, so it’s important to pace yourself. Procrastination often leads to unnecessary stress and lower quality work.

- **Ask Questions**: If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask. Engaging actively with the material helps deepen your understanding.

- **Engage in Discussions**: Participate actively in class discussions. Avoid relying on slides to answer questions; instead, contribute your thoughts and insights directly.

Disclaimer
-----------------

The instructor reserves the right to modify all policies within this syllabus including, but not limited to, number of assignments, weighting of assignments, and homework policies. Any significant changes will be announced to all students.
