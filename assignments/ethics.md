Cyber Security Ethics
====================================

**Spring 2025**

Even though this is an introductory course in Computer Security, you will be exposed to knowledge and techniques that can be used for hacking, penetrating and attacking various computer systems.

We will be discussing several attacks, explorations and implementations in this class, some of them quite nasty.

While these are an integral part of a course on Computer Security, applying them in the real world can lead to violation of local and international laws and/or of institutional policies, and it may be unethical. This will have very serious consequences: do not take it lightly. Under some circumstances, even probing for weaknesses may result in severe penalties, up to and including expulsion, civil fines, and jail time.

The existence of a security hole is no excuse. These issues concern not only professional ethics, but also YCP policy and state and federal law. If there is any question in your mind about what conduct is allowable, contact the instructor first.

Acting lawfully and ethically is your responsibility. Carefully read the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act [CFAA]( http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:18%20section:1030%20edition:prelim)), a federal statute that broadly criminalizes computer intrusion. This is one of several US laws that govern “hacking.”
Cyber Criminals are hunted down by [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber), [Secret Service <sup>*</sup>](https://www.secretservice.gov/investigation/cyber), [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) and many more.

Understand what the law prohibits — you don’t want to end up like:
