Additional information on the SEED project [site](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Web/Shellshock/).

### Additional Tasks

In class we demonstrated a simple method of using Shellshock to cause a Denial of Service attack. ```sleep``` is a command in Unix that suspends program execution for a specified time. Having this information, can you demonstrate another Shellshock attack to cause Denial of Service?

_Without clicking on any links_ and using Google, how useful to attackers are the results from searching the term: ```filetype:cgi inurl:cgi-bin``` or ```inurl:/cgi-bin/.cgi```?  

### Grading
